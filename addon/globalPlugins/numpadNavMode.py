# Numpad Nav Mode (numpadNavMode.py), version 0.3-dev
# An NVDA global plugin which allows toggling the numpad between NVDA navigation and Windows navigation modes.
# Written by Luke Davis, based on gesture modifications described by NV Access (specifically @Qchristensen and @feerrenrut) in issue #9549.
