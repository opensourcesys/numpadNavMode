### To do list

* Update to most recent addonTemplate.
* Switch to GitHub Actions.
* Add an option to turn off numlock automatically when NVDA loads.
* Move all config reprocessing to the extensionPoint, so profiles work.
* Add config checkboxes to follow or not config profile changes, maybe separately for numlock and nav mode.
* Refactor key handling so that all modifiers are possible.
* Switch from namedtuple to a metadata class.
* Investigate numlockManager's onHelp, and re-focusing code, to see if it can be useful.
